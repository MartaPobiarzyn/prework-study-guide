# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage was built to help keep track of the various concepts taught during this code bootcamp. 

The project was built in order to practice writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code whilst also keeping track of key bits of information about each coding language. 

I should be able to refer back to this project over the duration of the course, and add additional notes.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
